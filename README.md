# Square-well-range-R-a12-reff-
Contains a python script "find_R_from_a12_reff.py" which calculates range of the attractive square well range from the input s-wave scattering length and effective range reff. Works only for reff>0, a12<0, for a potential which does not support a two-body bound state. In a script "quantum_bose-bose_mixture_functional.py", one can also calculate energy per particle for a given density, s-wave scattering length a12<0 and effective range reff>0 of the attractive interactions.
